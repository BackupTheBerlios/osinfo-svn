	CDROM
	The cdrom module detects all optical (cd/dvd etc) drives in the system seen by lshw. The burning / read capabilites are reported only on the default verbosity level; increase verbosity to see all capabilities.
	
	This module is not 100% proof; there are known unresolved issue when lshw cannot see a drive.

COMPATIBILITY
	everything is collected honoring maximum portability and minimum dependency requirements; ie. using standard *nix tools. 

	x86 and amd64 architectures (desktop and laptop) with various hardware configurations were used. see the comments on specific modules for more information.

	the script has been currently tested on the following Linux distributions:
	o Gentoo 2005.1 and 2006.0
	o Ubuntu 5.10 and 6.06
	o Fedora Core 4 and 5
	o Red Hat 9
	o Suse 10.0
	o SlackWare

	o FreeBSD 6.0 has been tested as well.

DEPENDENCIES
	Some information is unavailable	without special (but quite common) packages, but the availability of these is tested, and no error messages are produced if these rarer tools are missing. See info below for a list of dependencies.
	
	COMMON DEPENDENCIES:
	o bash 2.02 or later (oldest tested bash is version 2.05.0)
	o awk, sed, seq, tr, bc, uniq, sort, GNU grep with support for extended regexps
	o util-linux (fdisk, column)
	o netcat (for sending the xml output over tcp)

	MODULE DEPENDENCIES:
