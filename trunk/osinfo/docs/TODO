*	"vv next line is header" dirty tag to workaround the column bug?
*	kerner src location
*	if /var/log/wtmp is not found, osinfo produces errors
*	if a user belongs to the same group twice, both memberships are
	printed. use uniq
	

FEATURES for 0.4:

*	daemon mode - write init scripts
*	don't display what isn't detected (without the -vv flag)
*	mod_network: wlan
*	fix: user/root problem
*	su_modules - run only su modules
*	std_modules - non-su modules
*	mod_hdd: scan_md
*	gentoo: total system build time ;-)


FEATURES FOR 0.5:
----------------

*	mod_hdd: scan_LVM
*	integrate udev ruleset more tightly
*	osinfo as a frontend for custom udev rules?


LATER FEATURES:
--------------

*	general usb device detection: cameras etc
*	hal/dbus stuff
*	window manager version
*	--checkdep switch


BUGS:

*	mod_applications: /dev/mem: Permission denied on RH9
*	fix indentation in print_stdout, modules where same value has
	multiple items are affected
*	mod_hdd doesn't work on fedora!
*	module_footer doesn't produce </moduleName> tag



GENERAL NOTES:
-------------

*	"svn revert somefile" to revert uncommited changes
	"svn up -r revnr somename" to revert to a specific version

*	"xmllint --valid osinfo.xml" to check if the xml output is valid 
	against the DTD 



PROGRAMMING TIPS:
----------------

*	there are at least two methods to parse an alphabetical seq number:
	 awk '{ ind=index("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", toupper($0)); print ind; }' <<< $'b\no\ns\na\ni'
	 NUM=$(( $(echo -n 'A' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' | od -A n -t u1) - 64)); echo $NUM
	 the latter works by subtracting the ASCII offset (64) from the uppercase character.

*	to use tab as a field separator in awk:
	 awk $'-F\t' {}

*	instead of awk, read can sometimes be used:
	fdisk -l | read a b c d e partition; echo "$partition"

*	Get tabsize dynamically: "tput it"
