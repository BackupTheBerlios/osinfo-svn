BUGS:
-----




GENERAL NOTES:
--------

* to check if the xml output is valid against the DTD run: xmllint --valid osinfo.xml

* XML
To handle XML we need a generic output interface.
Source a file with with the interface. There should be one file for xml output, one for kdialog output and one for normal.

* Get rid of eval.
* is it possible to run a for loop with the whitescapes, each line only
	constituting a new item in the loop, (not using whitescape, rather \n as the mark)?
	example:
		for line in `echo -e "foo\nbar baz"`; do echo $line; done
	would output:
		foo
		bar baz
	or is the only way to handle this to be creative with tr?
	This problems occurs in a couple of places in the script

* add a version sniffer for Gnome and fix X and KDE entries too in case they don't work everywhere
* add --checkdep 
* look into daemontools for the init script
* change value_header => add_value_header
* the headers array is fine, it's parsed linearly. if the entry in the array is not numbers only,
	it means it is a header or a footer. the footer has a %footer% identifier which closes the previous
	open tag. everything else is parsed to stdout or to xml. $indent variable is used to ensure proper format.
* use if sentence for smartctl with IDE drives
* parse all partition data into one line for each partition???
