3/27	Added perl for module_applications
		Dropped ':' from the end of output id string (makes xml formatting simpler)
		Added --xml support, prints to stdout for debugging
		Xml support requires additional print_module_footer function


3/29	argh. I did 'svn up' at another location, then 'svn ci' from another. It gave me an error:
	Transmitting file data .....svn: Commit failed (details follow):
	svn: Out of date: '/trunk/osinfo/ChangeLog' in transaction '40-1'
	svn: Your commit message was left in a temporary file:
	svn:    '/mnt/usbflash/scripts/osinfo/svn-commit.3.tmp'
	so I cp'd the files to hard drive, to the first location of 'svn up'
	and sent the files. seems the last revisions were overwritten.
	so that's how version control works :o -Ruxpin
