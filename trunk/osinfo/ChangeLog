	Tried to merge. But some modules says not found
	To recover them (I don't have time now): read the svn manual!

	Sigh. Why can't you:
        1) use ChangeLog for the right things and the right syntax.
        2) run svn up before commit on the other computer. That would NOT destroy your changes. It would merge them.
        3) Read the svn manual...

	argh. I did 'svn up' at another location, then 'svn ci' from another. It gave me an error:
        Transmitting file data .....svn: Commit failed (details follow):
	svn: Out of date: '/trunk/osinfo/ChangeLog' in transaction '40-1'
	svn: Your commit message was left in a temporary file:
        svn:    '/mnt/usbflash/scripts/osinfo/svn-commit.3.tmp'
        so I cp'd the files to hard drive, to the first location of 'svn up'
        and sent the files. seems the last revisions were overwritten.
        so that's how version control works :o

	Added perl for module_applications
	Dropped ':' from the end of output id string (makes xml formatting simpler)
	Added --xml support, prints to stdout for debugging
	Xml support requires additional print_module_footer function
