  hardware limits: 600 MHz - 1.70 GHz
  available frequency steps: 1.70 GHz, 1.70 GHz, 1.70 GHz, 1.70 GHz, 1.70 GHz, 1.40 GHz, 1.20 GHz, 1000 MHz, 800 MHz, 600 MHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative, ondemand, powersave, userspace, performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 600 MHz and 1.70 GHz.
                  The governor "conservative" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 600 MHz (asserted by call to hardware).
