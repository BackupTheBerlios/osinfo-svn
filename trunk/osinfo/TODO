* XML
To handle XML we need a generic output interface.
Source a file with with the interface. There should be one file for xml output, one for kdialog output and one for normal.

* Get rid of eval.
* update all modules to use print_module_footer and variable $moduleName,
	before that xml output is crippled
* is it possible to run a for loop with the whitescapes, each line only
	constituting a new item in the loop, (not using whitescape, rather \n as the mark)?
	example:
		for line in `echo -e "foo\nbar baz"`; do echo $line; done
	would output:
		foo
		bar baz
	or is the only way to handle this to be creative with tr?
	This problems occurs in a couple of places in the script

* add a version sniffer for Gnome and fix X and KDE entries too in case they don't work everywhere
* add a function to read data from BIOS. IMPORTANT!!!!
   lshw is the best shot for this
* add --checkdep
